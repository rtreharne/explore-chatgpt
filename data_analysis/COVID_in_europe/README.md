# COVID-19 in Europe Animation

Here I've used ChatGPT to create a [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uel_QW7skQvoG6_YgxfKQs8l2IAaMOLF?usp=sharing) that reads the file `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)

The code generates an animation showing the weekly new cases per million pop. of COVID for European countries (showing only the top 20 countries with the highest rates).
